(hereinafter “us” or “we”), processes personal data in connection with the activities and services concerning the operation of the website rustdesk.com and other websites or social media profiles run and managed by us (hereinafter the “Websites”).<br />

We therefore respect the confidentiality of your personal data and always proceed in accordance with the provisions of data protection legislation, in particular, Company Act 2058 of the Government of Nepal. <br/>

            With respect to the above, we use this Policy to inform you about how, for what purposes and to what extent we use your personal data and what information about you as a user of the Websites we may process. <br/>

            <h2 class=" h4 mt-4 mb-3">Definitions </h2>

            <strong> “Data processor” </strong> means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller; <br/>
